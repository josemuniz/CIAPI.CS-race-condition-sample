Sample app to show how the CIAPI.CS fails when many threads make requests
at the same time.

To start the process, just launch the app and push the “Start” button as
soon as it’s enabled. That button will start a one minute “thread storm”
that should trigger the bug. This usually happens very quickly, but since
it’s a concurrency issue, it might take you a few tries before the
exception is thrown. Please keep pushing the button until it happens.
